# CraftingStore Suggestions & Bugs

This repository is used to keep track of the feature request and bug reports on our platform. You can create, view and comment on the requests of other store owners.

**How to create an issue?**
1) Go to the "[Issues](https://github.com/CraftingStore/Suggestions/issues)" tab.
2) Select the desired template (feature request or bug report) - Issues without a template will be closed.
3) Enter your suggestion or bug details.
4) Submit the issue.

**How do we handle issues?**

We do not reply to suggestions or bug reports when you create them. We get notified about every issue that is created. We will look at what feature requests are popular, and what feature requests will benefit store owners the most. We will reply to issues when we have questions about them, have implemented them, or when there is something wrong with your issue. There is no need to "bump" your issue.

**Issue templates**

Every issue that is created must use our template, we will close issues that do not use one of the provided templates. You can choose between a Feature request and Bug report.
